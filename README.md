space-bastard-html5
===================

Old-fashioned space shooter game in HTML5 with own engine. 
Engine does not possess all functionality for many game genres yet,
it does not use JSON for data files, so can work localy - without http protocol


To try the game: download zip archive, unzip it and open index.html with browser (not all browsers are tested)
