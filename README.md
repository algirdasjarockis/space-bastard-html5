space-bastard-html5
===================

Old-fashioned space shooter game in HTML5 with own engine.
Engine does not possess all functionality for many game genres yet,
it does not use JSON for data files, so can work localy - without http protocol.

Main hero is impolite, rough pilot who does not care to save galaxy, just his own
arse from strange species flying around every corner. No time to hide!

Game coding progress: ~65%

Gameplay material progress: ~1%

To try the game: download zip archive, unzip it and open index.html with browser (not all browsers are tested).
For now all sounds are muted (actualy set very low volume) if you want to hear them, open Javascript console
in web browser's dev tools plugin (i.e. in Chrome browser press Ctrl+Shift+I) and write following line of javascript code:

SB.game.sm.volume(null, 1);
P.S. Amazing huh? You even can add 10000000000000000000000000 score for yourself and be the best (at knowing maximum number)
